      description: "Once our system processes your order, your products are inspected thoroughly to ensure they are in a perfect condition. After they pass through the final round of quality check, they are packed and handed over to our trusted delivery partner. Our delivery partners then bring the package to you at the earliest possibility. In case they are unable to reach your provided address or at a suitable time, they will contact you to resolve the issue."

      description: "We are committed to sustainability in our packaging while ensuring the safety of the orders dispatched. Our Smile Beauty cardboard outer box is eco-friendly and made from 100% recycled paper. Where feasible, we use paper-fillers instead of bubble wrap, and this is a process of continuous improvement for us. We are committed to further substantially reducing plastic in our packaging and are constantly innovating new solutions given the nature of our category."

      title: "What is the estimated delivery time?",
      description: "We usually dispatch most orders within 1-4 business days (excluding Sundays and public holidays). Though we keep 95% of our catalogue in our inventory, certain products need to be sourced directly from the brand itself so that we can live up to our promise of providing fresh, non-expired products. While we are trying our best to avoid this situation, these products might delay your order. If you are ordering our products from a Mega Sale event, dispatches may be a bit delayed due to increased volumes. We will target to dispatch all orders within 5 days of order date."

Rest assured, you will only have to pay the shipping/COD charge if applicable, on the first package you receive."
