    <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">1. Background</h4>
    <p className="mb-4">
      Customer satisfaction is one of the key focus areas and integral parts of Smile Beauty’s founding principles and business policies. We strongly believe that customer satisfaction is the most important factor in the growth and development of our business.
    </p>

    <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">2. Objective</h4>
    <p className="mb-4">
      The objective of this Grievance Policy is to provide a framework to ensure provision of timely and effective resolution of issues raised by customers, and to keep customers informed about the manner in which they can reach out to us to resolve their queries and grievances.
    </p>

    <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">3. Principles governing the Grievance policy</h4>
    <p className="mb-4">
      Policy on grievance redressal is governed by the following principles:
    </p>
    <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
      <li>Customer shall be treated fairly at all times.</li>
      <li>Issues raised by customers are always attended with courtesy and in time.</li>
      <li>Customers are provided with effective and satisfactory resolution within a reasonable time period.</li>
      <li>Customers are fully informed of avenues to escalate their issues/grievances if they are not fully satisfied with the response to their complaints.</li>

    <p className="mb-4">

    </p>

    </p>

    <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">5. Need to Know</h4>
    <p className="mb-4">
      Smile Beauty DOES NOT solicit confidential details like your OTP/CVV/PIN/Card Number/Bank account details through any means. Smile Beauty never calls users/customers with offers, discounts on products, and offering free gifts.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-4">
      Scamsters/fraudsters attempt various techniques such as ‘phishing’, to contact, influence, and defraud consumers. Smile Beauty regularly cautions its customers against sharing any personal or payment-sensitive information with unknown persons as such sharing leads to unauthorized use and/or fraud and consequent financial loss.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-4">
      Smile Beauty shall not be liable for any loss, damage, or expense incurred by a customer where the customer has shared personal and/or payment-sensitive information with scamsters/fraudsters.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-4">
      We also request and encourage our customers to report such attempts or incidents to our Grievance officer (or Customer care) to enable us to investigate and explore legal recourse.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-4">
      Smile Beauty relies on payment partners and banks. In certain cases involving payment/refund issues, we might see a delay as that is beyond our control once we pass the investigation to them; however, we try our best not to exceed timelines stated in this policy.
